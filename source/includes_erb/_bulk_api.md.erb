## Bulk API

### Creating a Bulk Job

Besides creating bulk jobs via the Diffbot UI, you can also create them via our API. To create a bulk job, make a POST request to `http://api.diffbot.com/v3/bulk`.

Set your `Content-Type` header to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (not `multipart/form-data`). Your POST body content should provide the following:

#### Required Arguments

| Argument           | Description      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `token`              | Developer [token](https://www.diffbot.com/pricing)  |
| `name`               | Job name. This should be a unique identifier and will be used to modify your bulk job and retrieve its output.          |
| `urls`               | Space-delimited list of URLs to process. |
| `apiUrl`             | The full Diffbot API to be used for each URL. For instance, to process each URL via the article API, supply `http://api.diffbot.com/v3/article`. You may also include API parameters, e.g. `http://api.diffbot.com/v3/article?fields=meta,tags`. |

#### Optional Arguments

| Argument           | Description      |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `notifyEmail`        | Send a message to this email address when the bulk job completes.           |
| `notifyWebhook`      | Pass a URL to be notified when the bulk job completes. You will receive a POST with the full JSON response in the POST body. |
| `repeat`             | Specify the number of days as a floating-point (e.g. `repeat=7.0`) to repeat this job. By default bulk jobs will not be repeated.  |
| `maxRounds`          | Specify the maximum number of repeats. Use `maxRounds=-1` to continually repeat.       |
| <nobr>`pageProcessPattern`</nobr> | Enter ||-separated strings to limit pages processed to those whose HTML contains any of the content strings. If a page does not contain at least one of the strings, it will be ignored.         |


### Response
> If successful, you'll receive this response:

```json
 "response": "Successfully added urls for spidering."
```

Upon adding a new bulk job, you will receive a success message in the JSON response, in addition to full job details.



### Pausing, Deleting or Restarting Bulk Jobs

You can manage your crawls by making GET requests to the same endpoint, `http://api.diffbot.com/v3/bulk`.

Provide the following data:

| Parameter | Description                                                                                                            |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `token`              | Developer [token](https://www.diffbot.com/pricing)  |
| `name`      | Job name as defined when the bulk was created.                                                                         |
| `pause`     | Pass `pause=1` to pause a bulk job. Pass `pause=0` to resume a paused job.                                                 |
| `restart`   | Pass `restart=1` to restart a bulk job. **This will erase all processed data and re-process all of the submitted URLs.** |
| `delete`    | Pass `delete=1` to delete a job, and all associated data, completely.                                                    |

### Retrieving Bulk API Data

To download results please make a GET request to the following URLs, replacing `token` and `jobName` with your token and bulk job name, respectively. The JSON data and URLs report URLs are also available in the Bulk API JSON response, as `downloadJson` and `downloadUrls`.

| URL  | Description            |
| --------------------------- | ---------- |
| `http://api.diffbot.com/v3/bulk/download/{token}-{jobName}_data.json`  | Download all JSON objects (as processed by Diffbot APIs).      |
| `http://api.diffbot.com/v3/bulk/download/{token}-{jobName}_data.csv`   | Download a subset of content -- top-level fields only -- as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.       |

Additionally, use `http://api.diffbot.com/v3/bulk/download/{my_token}-{jobName}_urls.csv` to download the "URLs report" CSV file. This lists all URLs attempted by the Bulk API, and the most recent status for each. Useful for debugging.

### Using the Search API to Retrieve Bulk Job Data

You can also use Diffbot's [Search API](#search-api) to fine-tune the data retrieved from one (or multiple) Crawlbot or Bulk API jobs.

[Search API documentation](#search-api)

### Viewing Bulk Job Details

Your active bulk jobs (and any active Crawlbot API crawls) will be returned in the `jobs` object in a request made to `http://api.diffbot.com/v3/bulk`.

To retrieve a single job's details, provide the job's `name` in your request:

| Parameter | Description                              |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `token`              | Developer [token](https://www.diffbot.com/pricing)  |
| name      | Name of bulk job (or crawl) to retrieve. |

To view all crawls, simply omit the `name` parameter.
