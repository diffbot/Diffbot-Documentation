### Custom HTTP Headers

You can supply Diffbot APIs with custom values for the user-agent, _referer_, cookie, or accept-language values in the HTTP request. These will be used in place of the Diffbot default values.

To provide custom headers, pass in the following values in your own headers when calling the Diffbot API:

Header | Description
--------- | -----------
X-Forward-User-Agent | Will be used as Diffbot's `User-Agent` header when making your request.
X-Forward-Referer | Will be used as Diffbot's `Referer` header when making your request.
X-Forward-Cookie | Will be used as Diffbot's `Cookie` header when making your request.
X-Forward-Accept-Language | Will be used as Diffbot's `Accept-Language` header when making your request.
