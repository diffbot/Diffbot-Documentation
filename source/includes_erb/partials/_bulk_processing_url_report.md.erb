The URL Report provides status on every URL crawled and/or processed by a Crawlbot or Bulk API job.

The report is a comma-separated-values (CSV) file, and is available to download from your crawl or bulk job status page as soon as a job has begun—

—or, using the Crawlbot or Bulk Service API, via the `downloadUrls` field.

Each row corresponds to a single URL evaluated, and provides the following information:

| Column         | Description  |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| URL            | Web page URL evaluated    |
| Doc ID         | Document ID of the crawled page. This corresponds to the `docId` field returned in crawl or bulk job JSON data.        |
| URL Discovered Time         | Time the URL was first seen/encountered.            |
| Crawled Time   | Time the URL was crawled (downloaded and its source spidered for links).      |
| Content Length | Number of characters comprising the HTML source.    |
| Duplicate Of   | If the page source is an exact duplicate of another page, the Doc ID of the duplicate page will be returned.         |
| Redirects      | Number of redirects pursued before arriving at the final destination URL.     |
| Redirected To  | Ultimate destination URL if redirected.|
| Robots.txt Crawl Delay (ms) | If the page is subject to a robots.txt "crawl delay" the value in milliseconds will be returned.        |
| Crawl Round    | If the crawl is a repeating/recurring crawl, the crawl "round" in which this URL was evaluated. Note: URLs will be duplicated for each round in which they are crawled.  |
| Crawl Try #    | If there is an error crawling the page (spidering for links), any retries will be enumerated.           |
| Hop Count      | This indicates the page's distance from seed(s): "1" indicates the URL was linked-to from a seed; "2" indicates the URL appeared on a page that itself was linked-to from a seed. Hops can be used to narrow crawling via Crawlbot's `maxHops` argument. |
| Crawl Status   | Returns "Success" if the page was successfully crawled (spidered for links).  |
| Diffbot URI    | If the page was processed via a Diffbot API, and an object—product, article, image, discussion, etc.—found, the object's `diffbotUri` will be returned.       |
| Process Attempted           | Indicates if the page was sent to a Diffbot API for processing.  |
| Process Response            | Indicates whether or not the Diffbot processing was successful.  |
