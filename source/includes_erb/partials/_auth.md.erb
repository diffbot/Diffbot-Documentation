### Authentication

You can supply Diffbot with basic authentication credentials or custom HTTP headers (see below) to access intranet pages or other sites that require a login.

### Basic Authentication
To access pages that require a login/password ([using basic access authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication)), include the username and password in your `url` parameter, e.g.: `url=http%3A%2F%2FUSERNAME:PASSWORD@www.diffbot.com`.
