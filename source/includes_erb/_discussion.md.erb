# Discussion API

The Discussion API automatically structures and extracts entire threads or lists of reviews/comments from most discussion pages, forums, and similarly structured web 
 pages. It is also a part of the [Product API](#product-api) and the [Article API](#article-api) - it will detect reviews/comments on those automatically unless disabled, and return them as an array inside the main `objects` array. See the respective API docs for more information and examples.

## Request

```shell
curl "http://api.diffbot.com/v3/discussion?token={token}&url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.diffbot.com%2Fdiffbots-new-product-api-teaches-robots-to-shop-online"
```

<%= partial("includes_erb/partials/to_use_api", :locals => { :api => "discussion" }) %>


### Required Arguments

```php
<?php

$diffbot = new Diffbot('my_token');
$url = 'https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5608988';
$discussionApi = $diffbot->createDiscussionAPI($url);
```

<%= partial "includes_erb/partials/table_required_arguments" %>

### Optional Arguments

```php
<?php

$discussionApi->setMeta(true);
 
// setters can also be chained

$discussionApi
            ->setBreadcrumb(true)
            ->setQuerystring(true)
            ->setLinks(true);
            
$discussionApi
            ->setSentiment(true)
            ->setMaxPages('all')
            ->setTimeout(30000);
```


| Argument           | Description    |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |<%= partial "includes_erb/partials/table_common_optional_arguments" %>| `maxPages`           | Set the maximum number of pages in a thread to automatically concatenate in a single response. Default = 1 (no concatenation). Set maxPages=all to retrieve all pages of a thread regardless of length. Each individual page will count as a separate API call. |

<%= partial("includes_erb/partials/fields", :locals => {:table => "response34"}) %>

## Response 

> Example: processing the link https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5608988

```php
<?php

echo $result->numPosts; // prints out 8
echo $result->getPosts()[0]->getAuthor; // prints out "miket"

// or, get the whole json dump with
$dump = $result->getResponse()->getBody();

// or as a PHP array
$dump = $result->getResponse()->json();

```

```shell
curl 'http://api.diffbot.com/v3/discussion?token={token}&url=https%3A%2F%2Fnews.ycombinator.com%2Fitem%3Fid%3D5608988&mentos&fields=links,meta,querystring,breadcrumb'

Diffbot's V3 APIs return information about **all** identified objects on a submitted page.

<%= partial "includes_erb/partials/each_response_intro" %>

The Discussion API returns all post data in a single object within the `objects` array.

Within the Article and Product APIs (to extract comments or review data), discussion data will be returned within the nested `discussion` object.

The Discussion API `objects` / `discussion` response will include the following fields:

**Default Fields**


| Field              | Description                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |<%= partial("includes_erb/partials/table_common_default_fields", :locals => {:object => "discussion"}) %>| `numPosts`           | Number of individual posts in the thread.                 |
| `posts`              | Array of individual posts. |
| `posts.type`               | Type of element (always `post`).                            |
| `posts.id`                 | ID of the individual post. The first post of a thread will have an ID of 0.  |
| `posts.parentId`           | ID of the parent, if the post is a reply or response.     |
| `posts.text`               | Full text of the extracted post.                          |
| `posts.html`               | Diffbot-normalized HTML of the extracted post. Please see the [HTML Specification](#html-field-specification) for a breakdown of elements and attributes returned.                         |
| `posts.tags`               | If the post is long enough, an array of tags generated from its specific content.                           |
| <nobr>`posts.humanLanguage`</nobr>     | Spoken/human language of the post, using two-letter [ISO 639-1 nomenclature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). |
| `posts.images`             | If any images are detected within post content, they will be returned in a separate array. Individual array fields are the same as the [Article API](#article-api)'s images array.               |
| `posts.date`               | Date of post, normalized in most cases to [RFC 1123 (HTTP/1.1)](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.3).               |
| `posts.author`             | Name/username of the post author.                         |
| `posts.authorUrl`          | URL of the author profile page, if available.             |
| `posts.pageUrl`            | URL of the page on which the post was found.              |
| `posts.diffbotUri`         | Internal ID used for indexing.                            |
| `tags`              | Array of tags/entities, generated from analysis of the extracted `text` and cross-referenced with [DBpedia](http://wiki.dbpedia.org/About).|
| `participants`       | Number of unique participants in the discussion thread or comments.          |
| `numPages`          | Number of pages automatically concatenated to form the text or html response. (By default, Diffbot will concatenate up to 20 pages of a single article.) [More on automatic concatenation](http://support.diffbot.com/automatic-apis/handling-multiple-page-articles).                |
| `nextPages`         | Array of all page URLs concatenated in a multipage article.       |
| `nextPage`           | If discussion spans multiple pages, nextPage will return the subsequent page URL.                           |
| `provider`           | Discussion service provider (e.g., Disqus, Facebook), if known.              |
| `rssUrl`             | URL of the discussion's RSS feed, if available.           |

---

**Optional fields, available using the `&fields=` argument**


| Field              | Description                |
| ------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sentiment`          | Returns a sentiment score of each individual post, a value ranging from -1.0 (very negative) to 1.0 (very positive).           |<%= partial "includes_erb/partials/table_optional_fields" %>                                |

## Options

### Comment Extraction

By default the Article API will attempt to extract comments from article pages, using integrated functionality from the Diffbot [Discussion API](#discussion-api) (This behavior can be disabled using the argument `discussion=false`). The same goes for reviews on Product API calls.

Comment / review data will be returned in the `discussion` object (nested within the primary article / product object). 

<%= partial "includes_erb/partials/auth" %>

<%= partial "includes_erb/partials/custom_http_headers" %>

### Posting Content

If your content is not publicly available (e.g., behind a firewall), you can POST markup or plain text directly to the Article API endpoint for analysis:

`http://api.diffbot.com/v3/article?token={token}&url={url}`

Provide the content to analyze as your POST body, and specify the `Content-Type` header as `text/html` (for full markup) or `text/plain` (for text-only).

Please note that if you submit HTML (default, if `Content-Type` is missing), the `url` argument is still required, and will be used to resolve any relative links contained in the markup.
