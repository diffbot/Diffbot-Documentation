# Search API

Diffbot's Search API allows you to search the extracted content of one or all of your Diffbot "collections." A collection is a discrete [Crawlbot](#crawlbot) or [Bulk API](#bulk-processing) job, and includes all of the web pages processed within that job.

In order to search a collection, you must first create that collection using either Crawlbot or the Bulk API. A collection can be searched before a crawl or bulk job is finished.

## Request

To use the Search API, perform a GET request on the following endpoint:

`http://api.diffbot.com/v3/search`

Provide the following arguments:

<table class="controls table table-bordered" border="0" cellpadding="5">
  <thead><tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>token</td><td>Developer <a href="/pricing">token</a></td></tr>
  <tr><td>query</td><td>Search query. Must be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding" target="_blank">URL-encoded</a>. Please see <a href="#query-operators">query operators</a> below.</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Optional arguments</strong></td></tr>
  <tr><td>col</td><td>Name of the collection (Crawlbot or Bulk API job name) to search. By default the search will operate on all of your token's collections.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>num</td><td>Number of results to return. Default is 20. To return all results in the search, pass <code>num=all.</code></td></tr>
  <tr><td>start</td><td>Ordinal position of first result to return. (First position is 0.) Default is 0.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>


## Query Operators
The query argument contains the actual search contents you wish to perform on your collection(s). Multiple operators and values can be combined.

<table class="controls table vanilla" border="0" cellpadding="5">
  <thead><tr><th>query=</th><th>Returns...</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>

The <code>min</code> or <code>max</code> operators work only with numeric or date fields. For date formatting options, see <a href="#date">Date Queries</a> below.</td></tr>
 <tr><td><span>max:<span style="color:#888">offerPrice:1000</span></span></td><td>All objects with an offerPrice value equal to or less than "1000." Must be a numeric or date field. For date formatting options, see <a href="#date-queries">Date Queries</a> below.</td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

#### Query URL Encoding
Be sure to [URL-encode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) your query. The following examples show some sample queries properly encoded.

<table class="controls table vanilla" border="0" cellpadding="5">
  <thead><tr><th>Query</th><th>URL-Encoded Query</th></tr></thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr><td>computer vision</td><td>computer%20vision</td></tr>
  <tr><td>obama type:article sortby:date</td><td>obama%20type%3Aarticle%20sortby%3Adate</td></tr>
  <tr><td>text:cats author:"Jet Li" min:date:1399669321</td><td><div class="wordwrap">text%3Acats%20author%3A%22Jet%20Li%22%20min%3Adate%3A1399669321</div></td></tr>
  <tr><td>min:date:"Thu, 22 May 2014 00:00:00 GMT"</td><td><div class="wordwrap">min%3Adate%3A%22Thu%2C%2022%20May%202014%2000%3A00%3A00%20GMT%22</div></td></tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

The space character can be represented by "%20" or the "+"-sign.

### Date Queries

You can query against Diffbot API `date` fields (the extracted article or discussion post date, for instance), or against the `timestamp` field, which represents the time of an object's indexing into the collection.


The `timestamp` field can be used to [return the latest content](http://support.diffbot.com/crawlbot/in-a-recurring-crawl-how-do-i-download-only-the-latest-rounds-content/) from a crawl or bulk job (e.g. `min:timestamp:2015-03-01`, for instance only the objects found in the last crawl round, or since the last search was run.

When querying dates, your date values should be in one the following formats:

- [ISO 8601](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), e.g. `2014-05-09` or `2014-05-10T17:40:25+00:00`
- [Unix timestamp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time), e.g. `1399669321`
- [RFC 1123 (HTTP/1.1)](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.3) , e.g. `"Fri, 09 May 2014 23:41:22 GMT"`

Be sure to wrap any space-containing date strings in quotation marks.

The Search API returns all matching objects found in the collection(s) searched.

Each response includes a `request` object (metadata specific to the search request), and an `objects` array, which will include the extracted information for all matching objects.

The specific fields returned within each object depend upon the type of each object, and the fields requested in the Crawlbot or Bulk API jobs that populate your collection(s).
